** Set up git
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     git config --global user.name "Vlad Dracula"
     git config --global user.email "vlad@tran.sylvan.ia"
     git config --global color.ui "auto"
     git config --global core.editor "nano -w"
     git config --list
   #+END_SRC
 global means to any repo we do
 git verb => all the commands.

** Creating a repository
  - Go to a common place to create a directory: ~/Desktop/
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     cd ~/Desktop/
     mkdir recipes
     cd recipes
   #+END_SRC

  - Initialise the repository
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     git init
   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     ls # doesn't show anything
     ls -a # it does! .git directory
   #+END_SRC

  - let's see the status:
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     git status # nothing new :)
   #+END_SRC

  - *Question*:
  What happens if git init inside another git repo?
  Whiteboard drawing.

** Tracking changes 
   modify-add-commit cycle
   where is the info stored?
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     nano guacamole.md
   #+END_SRC
   #+BEGIN_SRC text
     # Ingredients
     # Instructions
   #+END_SRC
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     ls # guacamole is there!
     git status # something new!
     git add guacamole.md
     git status # now is keeping track, but it's not "saved"
     git commit -m "Created template for recipe"
   #+END_SRC

   We've created a commit or revision with an identifier!
   -m : message for the revision.
   if you don't use the -m: you get nano to write, then you can write longer

   Good commit message: will I know by reading the commit message what I did?
                        will it be meaningful to others?

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     git status # shows nothing again :)

     git log # we see the history, our log; *full identifier*.
   #+END_SRC
   The info is stored in .git directory we saw before: ls -a

  - modify again
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     nano guacamole.md
   #+END_SRC
   #+BEGIN_SRC text
     # Ingredients
     - avocado
     - lemon
     - salt
   #+END_SRC
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    git status # shows which files has been modified
    git diff # shows all the changes
   #+END_SRC

    1) the command (a diff);
    2) labels of each file.
    3,4) the files being compared;
    5) line changes and where they occur.

    if we are happy with the changes, then proceed:
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     git commit -m "Added basic guacamole's ingredients"
     git status
   #+END_SRC


    *!!!UPSS!!!* We forgot to add, so nothing was committed

    *stagging area*
    Place we add change set but not yet committed
    Drawing (steps) / page!

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     nano  guacamole # new line => lemon -> lime
     git diff  # see the new line
     git add guacamole.md # added to the staging
     git diff # shows nothing

     git diff --staged # between last commit and what's in the staging area.
     git commit -m "Modified to the traditional recipe"
     git status
     git log  # Notice, if log is too long, ":" at the end of page? q to quit, spc to browse.

     git log -1
     git log --oneline
     git log --oneline --graph --all --decorate
   #+END_SRC

***  Recap

    Drawing with multiple files into .git

    *excercises*
    1.- commit messages.

    2.- changes to git / platform

    3.- BIO: green sticky when done, we pass and look at the differences

    //4.- Authorship



** exploring history
    - Indentify and use git commit numbers
    - compare various versions of tracked files
    - restore old verions
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     git diff HEAD~1 guacamole.md # tells us between HEAD (now) and HEAD~1
   #+END_SRC

   We could compare even further in time
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     git diff HEAD~2 guacamole.md  # HEAD~123 Goes 123 commits back in time.
   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     git diff xxxxxxxxxxx guacamole.md # that id is unique
   #+END_SRC

   but we can run it just with the first few, because typing all is too much
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     git dif ff23b4e guacamole.md
   #+END_SRC


   *restore an old versions*

   let's overwrite our file by mistake,
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     nano guacamole.md # delete all write something new.
                       # There's somewhere where the avocados are red

     git status # there few changes, but they haven't been staged
   #+END_SRC

   To recover them back:
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     git checkout HEAD guacamole.md
   #+END_SRC

   *CHECKOUT* restores an old version. In that case we are recovering the version in HEAD
   but we could recover any tother version:
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     git checkout XXXXXX guacamole.md
   #+END_SRC


   *common case* git status tell you how! :)
   -- is to tell git is a file, and not a commit identifier.

   # excercises
   - Jennifer files in python: 5)
   - venus changes: 2)

** Multiple files
   nano readme.md
   -
   -
   nano guacamole.md
   - peel the guacamole, remove the seed and add it to a bowl
** Ignoring things
   - Configuring git to ignore files
   - explain why it is useful.
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     mkdir receipts # groceries
     touch a.png b.png c.png receipts/a.jpg receipts/b.jpg
     # or touch {a..z}.dat results/sample_{020..300}.out
   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     git status
   #+END_SRC
   new files!

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     nano .gitignore
   #+END_SRC
   #+BEGIN_SRC text
     *.dat
     results/
   #+END_SRC

   We need to add it to the repository
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     git add .gitignore
     git commit -m 'ignoring dat and result files'
   #+END_SRC

   Try to add a.dat
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     git add a.dat
   #+END_SRC
   Help from git! :) - (read the output!)

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     git status --ignored # to see all the files
   #+END_SRC

   - excercises
     1) results/plots
     !if you don't put the slash and get a file in the future called plots then

     2) check man gitignore
     !final.dat

     3) results/data/**

     4) as noting

     5) log files

** Remotes in GH
   - Explain what remote repositories are and why are useful
   - push to or pull from a remote repository
   - Log in into github; create new repository: recipes

   [[http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/fig/git-freshly-made-github-repo.svg][Diagram]]
   GitHub does: (mkdir recipes; cd recipes; git init)

   Copy the url (https) and add it as our remote
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     git remote add origin .... #=> magic under .git
     git remote -v
   #+END_SRC

   - what's origin?
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     git push origin master
   #+END_SRC

   *windows* unset SSH_ASKPASS # if people has troubles.

   We can pull also from the remote:
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     git pull origin master
   #+END_SRC


   - excercises
     - Explain to your peer how git push is different of git commit

** Collaborating
   - clone a remote repository
   - collaborate and push

   Add collaborators to your repository.
   Diagram with the repository.

*** step by step

    *Collaborator*
      #+BEGIN_SRC bash
        git clone htt... recipes_<name_friend> # Otherwise it will fail as we have a recipes already
        # Note that some people may do it inside the previous recipes
        cd recipes_<name_friend>
        nano hummus.md
      #+END_SRC
      #+BEGIN_SRC text
        # Ingredients
        - chickpeas
        - lemon
        - olive oil
        - salt
      #+END_SRC
      #+BEGIN_SRC bash
       git add hummus.md
       git commit -m 'Ingredients for hummus added'
       git push origin master
      #+END_SRC

    *Owner*
      #+BEGIN_SRC bash
        git pull origin master
      #+END_SRC

*** Excercise
    - switch roles and repeat process (with other stuff)
      (add instructions for Guacamole:
      - put one avocado into a bowl.
      - pinch of salt in the bowl
      - add a tablespoon of lime in the bowl
      - mix it well
      - serve it with tortillas.

    - review changes
    - comments on github
 


** Conflicts
   - Explain what conflicts are and when they occur
   - Resolve conflicts

     guacamole.md - contains some text
     we add a line at the end with our name; add, commit and push
     = the other partner: without updating the repository:
     add a new line at the end, add, commit and push
     *!rejected!*
     # diagram!
     we need to pull first.
     git pull => *Conflict*
     open the file: check for the conflicts
     Now you choose which one you want.
     git add, commit, push *solved*
